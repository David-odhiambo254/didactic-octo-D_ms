		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="html"><strong>J) HTML & Code Structure</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>This system is a fixed layout with two columns. All of the information within the main content area is nested within a div with a class of "content". The sidebar's (column #2) content is within a div with a class "left-bar". The general HTML structure is the same throughout the system.</p>

		<p>The system is built on a simple PHP Framework all view files are under views folder and included files such as sidebar, header, footer & email templates files are under views/includes folder, controllers and function files are in the src folder. All uploads go to the uploads folder. </p>

		<hr>

		<h3 id="csscode"><strong>K) CSS Files and Structure</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>Landa uses two CSS files in this system. The first one is a bootstrap. Many browser interpret the default behavior of html elements differently. By using a bootstrap CSS file, we can work round this. This file also contains many styling of most elements and layouts, such as anchor tag colors, font-sizes, buttons, typography, etc. Keep in mind, that some of these values are overridden in the second file.</p> 

		<p>The second file contains all of the specific stylings for Landa System. The file is separated into sections.The first sections is for styling larger screens and the second section is for smaller devices for responsivenes</p>  

		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="jscode"><strong>L) JavaScript</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>This theme imports four main Javascript files.</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>jQuery</li>
			<li>app.js</li>
			<li>schedule.js</li>
			<li>fullcalendar.min.js</li>
		</ol>
		  
		<ol>
			<li>jQuery is a Javascript library that greatly reduces the amount of code that you must write.</li>
			<li>app.js is a javascript file that contains most of the landa system functionality. Some of the functions include Adding reminders, opening and closing of the menu, lanching modals etc. This file is also global and when eddited it's changes will be seen throughout the system</li>
			<li>schedule.js is the file that creates schedules and fetches them as well, this file relies heavily on the fourth file fullcalendar.min.js which is an open source calendar plugin
			</li>
			<li>fullcalendar.min.js is an open source Javascript library that is used to create and modify calendars easily. It's also used for events /scheduling among other features.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="phpcode"><strong>M) PHP code  </strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>Landa uses PHP exclusively for server side coding, all view files are under views folder and included files such as sidebar, header, footer & email templates files are under views/includes folder, controllers and function files are in the src folder. There are two major files to take note of;</p>
		
			<ol>
				<li>Routes - /src/routes.php</li>
				<li>Landa - /src/landa.php</li>
			</ol>
		
		<p>If you'd like to change the routes, open "/src/routes.php", make the necessary adjustments, and then save the file. This file holds all the paths of the system so be careful when editting it.</p> 
		
		<p>/src/landa.php contains functions that are repeated on the system,  so it is put on this class in order to re-use it inside the controllers.</p>
		
		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="credits"><strong>N) Sources and Credits</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>We've used the following js/PHP libraries on the development of Landa.
		
		<ul>
			<li>PHPMAILER - https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer</li>
